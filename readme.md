## PROBLEM
A client had a subscription to this internet service provider. They promised him a certain number of download and upload speeds. Sometimes, their internet speeds would fall short of the promised speeds. Anytime this happens, the client has to go to twitter and complain on twitter while tagging them in a tweet. Ofcourse to do this almost everytime you have a slow internet is a boring and tediuos task. Client then sought for help. 

## SOLUTION
The client reached out to me and i built a bot that checks for his internet speed at the moment and automatically make a tweet tagging his internet service provider. So from now, anytime he experiences a low internet speed, he runs the python script and it automatically makes the complaint on twitter. This twitter bot solves the client needs perfectly.
